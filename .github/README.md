<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There is very little setup required to get AHKser running, however some parts are required. Failing to follow the guidelines may affect AHKser. No explosions, I promise.

### Prerequisites

First, you will need to meet these requirements.
* Windows OS (From within the last decade should be fine). I don't own Apple products and don't have the capacity to port and develop for linux presently.
* [AutoHotkey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed. V1 and V2 can coexist perfectly fine, but I write exclusively for V2.


### Installation

1. Get the newest release of [AHKser](https://github.com/Stefarling/AHKser/releases/latest).
2. You might have to unblock the download if your web browser or operaing system is twitchy.  [Read more about why](https://allaboutcookies.org/antivirus-false-positive).
3. AHKser.exe is portable and will create the needed files where it lives. You get to give it a happy home somewhere.
4. Updating is as simple as replacing AHKser.exe with an updated version.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### First Run

Upon running AHKser for the first time, your scripts list will most likely be empty, sans the default included scripts.\
When adding more scripts, make sure they go in the Scripts folder or whatever folder you have chosen in settings as your home for scripts.\
Only .ahk files will be recognized presently, and AHKser relies on the formatting of the files to be a certain way for most of it's functions to work. If you'd like to make you own scripts, you should study the formatting of the included scripts.\
For now, you should be able to get more scripts from [PaliaHotkeys](https://github.com/Stefarling/PaliaHotkeys/releases/latest), specifically for the Palia game. Refer to the documentation in that repo for documentation.\
Don't forget to check out the Settings menu for important toggles, or the Help menu for the documentation.
