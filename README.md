# AHKser
Script Manager for AHK scripts.

Scripts can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Stefarling/PaliaHotkeys

Place any scripts you wish to manage in Scripts folder, in the same folder you run AHKser from.
Subfolders can be used to categorize scripts for convenience.
Double-Click a script to start/stop it, or select a script then click the Start/Stop buttons.
To see where your scripts live, click Open Scripts Folder.

This is highly experimental and no promises as to stability yet!
